							<h2>My Story<br />

						<p>
                            After graduating in Accounting and Finance from De Montfort University, I took a well-deserved summer break, during which I played golf, engaged in padel, and participated in charity work. As summer ended and the days grew shorter, I was eager to embark on my professional journey. I began my career as an Estates Executive, supporting three Estates Managers across a broad region, from the north of Scotland down to Milton Keynes. This role involved significant customer interaction, managing relationships with numerous councils. It honed my ability to assess client needs, ensure contract fulfillment, and develop a range of professional skills.

                           <p> The extensive travel required in my previous role began to take a toll, prompting me to explore career options that better aligned with my personal needs. During this time, I discovered the world of technology—a field that had always intrigued me. I had previously dabbled in coding, creating basic bots and algorithms for cryptocurrency trading, but never pursued it further. To explore this interest, I enrolled in FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course and found it highly engaging. It became clear to me that my next career move would be in the tech industry, although I was still undecided on a specific path. The FreeCodeCamp course provided a foundation geared towards front-end web development and software engineering. From there, I created a personal roadmap, starting with building websites for friends and family and experimenting with Swift to develop an iOS app for a printing company.</p>
                            
                           <p> By this point, I was fully immersed in the tech world, with my YouTube and TikTok feeds filled exclusively with tech content. The projects I had been working on provided valuable insight into my strengths and areas for improvement, helping me to refine my career focus. This journey led me to cloud computing—a field that perfectly combines customer interaction, problem-solving, and coding. In June 2024, I made the decision to leave my full-time job to dedicate myself entirely to pursuing a career in cloud computing. As of now, I have completed the AWS Cloud Practitioner course and am preparing to schedule my certification exam. I am actively working on several projects utilizing AWS services such as Lambda for serverless computing, CloudFront for content delivery, and other tools like S3, RDS, and Elastic Beanstalk. These projects showcase my ability to develop scalable solutions and address real-world challenges using cloud technologies. I invite you to visit the projects section of my website to explore these examples and see what I have accomplished.</p>
